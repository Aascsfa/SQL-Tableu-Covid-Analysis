# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
This project explores COVID-19 data to gain insights into the pandemic's global and regional impact. The analysis is performed using SQL and covers various dimensions such as case trends, mortality rates, population impact, and vaccination progress.

## Dataset Overview
The project uses two datasets:
- Coviddeaths: Contains information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population data by country and date.
